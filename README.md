## x-touch adapter for ioBroker

Communicate with a Behringer X-Touch Control Surface (DAW Controller)

## ToDo
- Add the syncGlobal functionality
- Add the recreation of banks if option is set

## Message Box
There a two acepted commands:
* `export` exports the actual values stored in the states of the devicegroups to the userdata folder x-touch.0
* `import` imports the youngest file from the userdata folder. Additionally you can specify `file` and/or the `devicegroup` number to restore. If `path` is specified the entire filesystem will be used and a `file` name is mandatory.
